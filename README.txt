    Its only one sheet that controls the entirity of the html pages.

  -< For About Page File >-
    About page gives 2 sentences with a brief information about the game. As well as a little contact box in the left side bottom.

    Shows the outline of the page with lorem text as a place holder as the game is still in development.

  -< For Blog File >-
    Uses a table that can be easily added to if there need be. In this table of cells there is 2 boxes that each hold there own text one for version 
  of the game it was updated to, and the name of the update.
  
    -< Across All Pages >-
      There is a title across the top that goes wtih the page. Along with the game logo that stays in the same place no mater what page you go on. 
    The menu to the side stays there no matter what happens, and when the buttons are pressed they send you to the correct page; although in the github
    preview it doesn't seem to work, but works when I load it from my computer.
